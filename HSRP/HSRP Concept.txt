What is HSRP?
    *HSRP is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol that ensures network availability by providing automatic failover of the default gateway in a network.

Why we use HSRP?
    * In a network, hosts (like PCs, printers, etc.) are typically configured with one default gateway. If that gateway fails, those devices canâ€™t reach outside networks (like the internet). HSRP solves this by providing a virtual IP that is always available, even if one router goes down.

How HSRP Works?
    * Multiple routers are grouped into an HSRP group.
    * One router is Active (handling traffic).
    * Another is Standby (ready to take over if active fails).
    * The rest (if any) are in a Listen state.
    * They all share a virtual IP address and virtual MAC address.
When the active router goes down, the standby router becomes active immediately, and hosts continue to send traffic without disruption.
