RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count as its routing metric. It's one of the simplest dynamic routing protocols, making it ideal for small to medium-sized networks.
It has Scalability Issues Max 15 hops makes it unsuitable for large networks. Uses UDP port 520. Default routing updates Sent every 30 seconds.

RIP v1 is classful — it doesn’t send subnet mask info, so it can't handle VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) or discontiguous networks.
RIP v2 is classless — it includes subnet masks in updates, supports CIDR, and uses multicast instead of broadcast.

By default, RIP summarizes routes at classful boundaries (e.g., assumes 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 are part of 192.168.0.0/16).
No auto-summary prevents RIP from summarizing and ensures routes are advertised with their actual subnet masks.






For the diagram shown in the image the configuration is:

Router0: 
    conf t
    router rip
    version 2
    no auto-summary
    network 192.168.1.0
    network 10.0.1.0
    network 10.0.2.0
    exit

Router1:
    conf t
    router rip
    version 2
    no auto-summary
    network 192.168.2.0
    network 10.0.1.0
    network 10.0.4.0
    exit

Router2:
    conf t
    router rip
    version 2
    no auto-summary
    network 192.168.3.0
    network 10.0.2.0
    network 10.0.3.0
    exit

Router3:
    conf t
    router rip
    version 2
    no auto-summary
    network 192.168.4.0
    network 10.0.3.0
    network 10.0.4.0
    exit
